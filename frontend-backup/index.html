                        <strong>Detective Conan</strong> (名探偵コナン, Meitantei Konan), also known as <strong>Case
                            Closed</strong> in English-speaking countries,
                        is a Japanese detective manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. The story follows
                        the adventures of
                        a teenage detective who is transformed into a child while investigating a mysterious
                        organization.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="article-heading">The Story Begins</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        <strong>Shinichi Kudo</strong> is a brilliant high school detective who frequently assists the
                        police in solving complex cases.
                        During an investigation, he is ambushed by members of a crime syndicate known as the
                        <strong>Black Organization</strong>.
                        They force-feed him an experimental poison intended to kill him, but instead of causing death,
                        the drug mysteriously
                        shrinks his body to that of a six-year-old child.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="article-heading">A New Identity</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        To protect his identity and continue his investigation into the Black Organization, Shinichi
                        adopts the pseudonym
                        <strong>Conan Edogawa</strong>. He moves in with his childhood friend <strong>Ran Mouri</strong>
                        and her father,
                        <strong>Kogoro Mouri</strong>, who runs a private detective agency. While maintaining his cover
                        as an elementary school student,
                        Conan secretly solves cases by using his brilliant deductive reasoning.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="article-heading">The Detective Method</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        Conan's unique approach involves using Dr. Agasa's special tranquilizer watch to sedate Kogoro
                        Mouri, then employing a
                        voice-changing bowtie to present his deductions through the sleeping detective. This clever ruse
                        allows him to solve cases
                        while keeping his true identity hidden. He also forms the <strong>Detective Boys</strong> group
                        with his elementary school classmates,
                        who often assist in his investigations.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="article-heading">Key Characters & Allies</h3>
                    <p class="article-text">
                        Throughout his journey, Conan encounters numerous allies including <strong>Heiji
                            Hattori</strong>, a fellow teenage detective from Osaka;
                        <strong>Ai Haibara</strong>, a former Black Organization member who created the shrinking drug;
                        and various police detectives
                        from different regions. He also crosses paths with the mysterious phantom thief <strong>Kaito
                            Kid</strong>, adding complexity
                        to his dual life as both child and detective.
